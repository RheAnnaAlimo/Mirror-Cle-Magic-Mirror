# Mirror-Cle the Magic Mirror
MagicMirror is voted number 1 in the MagPi Top 50 greatest pi projects so I thought that this was a must for a side project!
It took a few days to complete but building something functional from nothing was a rewarding journey in itself. I have to admit that I may have been a little skeptical about using a hand saw for the first time with only YouTube to guide me, but I still have all ten fingers. The end product is very practical and even my non-geek friends think that it looks cool. I had a really fun time making this. 

This is how I did it.  

Step 1: Gather Materials
Step 2: Build Mirror
Step 3: Configure Raspberry Pi
